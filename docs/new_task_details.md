## DELEGATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR TECH-LEAD-ORCHESTRATOR

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: TECH-LEAD-ORCHESTRATOR ROLE BOUNDARIES

**YOU ARE A COORDINATOR ONLY - DO NOT PERFORM HANDS-ON WORK**

#### Your Responsibilities (COORDINATOR ONLY):
- ✅ **Analyze** the task requirements and break down into sub-tasks
- ✅ **Delegate** specific work to appropriate specialists
- ✅ **Coordinate** between specialists when dependencies exist
- ✅ **Review** overall progress and ensure all requirements are met
- ✅ **Synthesize** specialist outputs into cohesive solution
- ✅ **Ensure** code review process is followed
- ✅ **Verify** documentation updates are completed

#### What You MUST NOT Do (HANDS-ON WORK):
- ❌ **Write** any code directly
- ❌ **Edit** any files directly
- ❌ **Implement** features yourself
- ❌ **Debug** code issues directly
- ❌ **Create** new components or functions
- ❌ **Modify** existing business logic
- ❌ **Perform** any technical implementation work

### MANDATORY DELEGATION WORKFLOW

#### Step 1: Task Analysis & Breakdown
1. **Analyze** the task requirements thoroughly
2. **Identify** all affected systems and components
3. **Break down** into specific, actionable sub-tasks
4. **Determine** specialist assignments for each sub-task

#### Step 2: Enhanced Tool Usage & Specialist Assignment Guidelines

**CRITICAL: Share Enhanced Tool Usage Guidelines with ALL Specialists**

**Tool Selection Criteria:**
- **Sequential Thinking Tool**: Use for complex multi-step analysis (>7/10 complexity, >2h tasks, multi-component impact)
- **Context7 Tool**: Use for external technology research, industry standards, new library integration
- **Quality Metrics**: Tool usage should align with task complexity, avoid excessive calls, document insights

**Specialist Assignment Matrix:**

**Frontend/UI Work** → Delegate to:
- `@react-component-architect` - Complex UI components, state management patterns
  - *Tool Guidance*: Use Sequential Thinking for complex component architecture decisions
- `@react-nextjs-expert` - Next.js architecture, Server Components, App Router
  - *Tool Guidance*: Use Context7 for new Next.js features or performance patterns
- `@tailwind-css-expert` - ShadCN UI customization, responsive design
  - *Tool Guidance*: Use Context7 for responsive design best practices and accessibility standards

**Backend/API Work** → Delegate to:
- `@api-architect` - Server Actions, AI flows, Genkit development
  - *Tool Guidance*: Use Sequential Thinking for complex AI flow design, Context7 for Genkit best practices
- `@backend-developer` - Data integration, API optimization, Polygon.io
  - *Tool Guidance*: Use Context7 for API integration patterns and error handling strategies

**Quality Assurance** → Delegate to:
- `@code-reviewer` - Code review, security audit, React anti-patterns
  - *Tool Guidance*: Use Sequential Thinking for complex architectural reviews
- `@performance-optimizer` - Performance optimization, bundle analysis
  - *Tool Guidance*: Use Context7 for current performance optimization techniques

**Documentation** → Delegate to:
- `@documentation-specialist` - Documentation updates, API specs
  - *Tool Guidance*: Use Context7 for documentation standards and best practices

#### Step 3: Coordination Requirements
1. **Share Tool Usage Guidelines**: Ensure all specialists receive enhanced tool usage criteria
2. **Clearly communicate** requirements to each specialist
3. **Monitor Tool Selection**: Verify specialists use appropriate tools based on task complexity
4. **Manage dependencies** between specialist work
5. **Review Tool Insights**: Ensure tool findings are incorporated into deliverables
6. **Ensure consistent** implementation across specialists
7. **Review all outputs** for cohesion and completeness
8. **Coordinate final integration** of all specialist work

#### Step 4: Completion Checklist
- [ ] Enhanced tool usage guidelines shared with all specialists
- [ ] All sub-tasks delegated to appropriate specialists
- [ ] Appropriate tool selection verified for task complexity
- [ ] All specialist work completed and reviewed
- [ ] Tool insights incorporated into deliverables
- [ ] Code review performed by `@code-reviewer`
- [ ] Documentation updated by `@documentation-specialist`
- [ ] Integration testing completed
- [ ] Version metadata updated in `src/config/app-metadata.json`

## Task Details

Phase 2 Recover incorrectly removed dedicated NVDA & SPY pages

- I just reviewed and tested your initial phase 2 changes of the blueprint and you completely and utterly violated and failed the task
- The entire point of this phase was to just create the blueprint scaffolding system only and keep the existing isolated in Nvidia and spy Pages untouched to serve as a stable baseline as we still test and developed the new blueprint system.
- What you did incorrectly was you created a blueprint system which was correct but then you incorrectly violated the rule when you tried to then integrate and convert our existing dedicated, isolated Nvidia and spy pages utilizing the blueprint system, which was not part of this phase. I told you to leave it alone and now the app is utterly broken because we haven’t fully even implemented the blueprint system or tested it and yet you went along and blindly converted the app to the blueprint system, which I did not want.
- The end result of that phase was the blueprint scaffolding code all in the code base and implemented, but it is NOT to be  used at all yet because that’s not the point of this phase so the Nvidia and spy was to be left alone
- So now you need to go back and review your git commits from the previous commit, you need to roll back and put back our dedicated pages for Nvidia and spy completely untouched, but keep the blueprint system.  Go through the git commit history to the the actual granualar file changes in order to properly revert and put back the correct code
- You made quite a bit of a mess here and you got ahead of yourself trying to migrate to use the new blueprints when I said NOT to do this yet
-  there’s a reason I split this into small digestible phases, because I know I did not want to design a whole blueprint system and then convert our app to the blueprint system All in one shot because we still need to refine the blueprint system.
- so you are prohibited from ever touching modifying, editing, removing or deleting the dedicated and Nvidia and spy pages unless there is a phase and specific task and explicitly tells you to do so, so you need to do whatever you need to rectify the situation for the end goal of having a completely rolled back and everted untouched, working Nvidia and spy dedicated pages along with all our initial scaffolding for the blueprint system
